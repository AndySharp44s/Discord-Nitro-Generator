# Discord Nitro Generator
With this program, you can generate as many Discord Nitro codes as you want, using the current promotion from chess.com. Save the codes in an easy-to-use text file.

## TODO
My intention is that every time I see a promotion like this I will add it to this program so that codes can always be generated.

## Dependencies
You need a list of HTTP proxies; the better they are, the more accounts you will obtain. I recommend using those from [ProxyScrape](https://proxyscrape.com).

## Credits
Completely programmed by me.
