## THE CHESS.COM PROMOTION HAS ENDED, WHEN ANY OTHER PROMOTION IS AVAILABLE I WILL IMPLEMENT IT TO THE PROGRAM, UNTIL THEN THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT GENERATE CODES.

# Discord Nitro Generator
With this program, you can generate as many Discord Nitro codes as you want, using the current promotion from chess.com. It saves the codes in an easy-to-use text file.

## TODO
My intention is to add every promotion like this to the program so that codes can always be generated.

## Dependencies
You need a list of HTTP proxies; the better they are, the more accounts you will obtain. I recommend using those from [ProxyScrape](https://proxyscrape.com).

## Credits
Completely programmed by me.
